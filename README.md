# Linear Regression in Machine Learning

-the data set used was an artificial dataset on Housing in the US

-Performed Exploratory Data Analysis , for better understanding of the data(.describe(), info(), head(). shape())

-split the data into X and y, based on the features and the target

-used sciKit Learn to split the data into train and test data for Supervised Machine Learning

-fit a model to the training data

-make predictions on the target value, y(Price)
